# Howto Doit Right

First define an atmosphere, nice and airy, little scary.
then a kick, a sharp kick, maybe thick.
and then a snare, loud, maybe.

But the critical component of generative music is LIKE-RANDOMNESS,
that is to say, always select multiple samples, multiple sounds that sound alike.

Hold down Command (Mac) or Control (Win?) to mark similar sounding samples,
when multiple sound samples are chosen Harlequin will play one at random.

Pay attention to the changing "tags" just the moment the song will feel a wee stale,
a new tag will pop in, you are to add a new motif, it need not be a large change,
just something new, maybe a little odd even pair, or even Choir/Vinyl-scratch combo.

The human ear will love it, it will remain entertained through the entire piece.

Finally, if it sounds bad, you don't have an atmosphere, you don't have a background,
you need a whine in the darkness of the background of your music. And if you have a background,
than what you are missing is the kick/snare combo, you paired sounds that are too near each other;
the kick snare must be soft/sharp, or sharp/heavy. And if you are still stuck,
reload, or just come back later. The music is here, it just needs a rested ear.
